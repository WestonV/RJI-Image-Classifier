### Sprint 3 update:

So far, we have built a system that allows a user to upload images, download images, and get their images ranked. Our system doesn't work the exact way we want it to, as we have run into some capacity and performance issues, however, we have made great progress and are proud of our work. The issues we've run into have come from classifying the photo while uploading the photo. It puts too much stress on our server, and causes it to malfunction. Presently, once we are able to get this issue fixed, our end product will be exactly what we set out for it to be in its simplest form: a system where a user can upload a batch of photos and have them ranked by the classifier, and then proceed to download the photos with its ranked score added to the metadata.
